# Synthetic Pair Deviation Engine

A high-performance, C++-based arbitrage detection system for cryptocurrency markets. This engine calculates synthetic trading pair prices in real-time, compares them to actual market rates, and detects profitable arbitrage opportunities across exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Real-time data from Binance, OKX, and Bybit via WebSocket
- ✅ Synthetic price calculation from multi-leg market formulas
- ✅ Arbitrage opportunity detection and spread evaluation
- ✅ Modular architecture with clean separation of components
- ✅ Risk & exposure management using portfolio metrics (VaR, ES)
- ✅ In-memory caching for high-speed access
- ✅ CLI terminal log output of arbitrage legs and metrics
